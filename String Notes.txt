String is a class in java.lang

Heap Memory=>area in jvm where objects are stored
string constant pool=>pool to store string literals(variables/objects)

String is an immutable class,once the object of the class is created then we cannot change its value but if we create variable using String as data type then those variables are mutable
Everytime we manipulate the string object,new String object is created in the memory hence String is called as immutable class

String val=new String("sample")	//val is immutable

String txt="Demo";	//txt is mutable

Data types
	premitive
	derived
	reference=>String,Array

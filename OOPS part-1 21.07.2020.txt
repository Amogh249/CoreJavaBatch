Array is reference variable and by default it refers to first memory location and all further memory locations as an offset from first one hence array accesses memories by index in which the first index to which it by default refers is 0 and next in the sequence has an offset of 1


OOPS
Object Oriented Programming System
	Attributes and functions applicable to one object will be 
	applicable to all the objects of same category

Two pillars of OOPS
	Objects and Classes
	
	Objects
		Any real world entity is referred to as an object
		An object can be identified by its state and 		behavior

	OOPS		General			Programatic
	state		props/Attributes	variables
	behavior	Functionality		methods
	identity	unique thing		constants

	Two object can have same state and behavior but will never 		have same identity
	
	Classes
	Collection of objects having same state and behavior or
	objects belonging to particular class will exhibit all the 		states and behavior of that class

	classes are conceptual but objects are physical

	Objects of two classes can communicate with each other 	through messages
	Action taken by one object in response to message given by 	another object is called as method

Why OOPS?
	Realistic Modelling
		everything can be related to real world,hence 		problem solving becomes easy
	
	Reusability
		code written for one object can be used for another 		object

	Resilience(flexibility) to change
		existing code can be modified very easily

	
	Modularity
		Separation of concerns
		inter-related things will be bundled together
		while troubleshooting the code,only particular 		module is affected and not all 

		Loose Coupling
		Dependency upto least extent
	
	Information hiding
		Allows to show the information which is required by 		the user and not everything
		Hiding unneccessary information from the user

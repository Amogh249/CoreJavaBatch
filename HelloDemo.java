//packages->pre-defined set of library files those help us to //develop and execute the code
//package needs to be imported as required
//In earlier versions of Java,we had to import the package called //java.util
//but now after java version 7 it imports java.lang by default so we need not to import //it
//in one program we can have many classes but only one public class
//this public class should have declaration of main function and hence this class can also be //called as main class
//Name of the main class or the class which main function is //declared as public,should be the file name
//otherwise compiler throws an error
//main function is an entry point for compiler

public class HelloDemo
{	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}

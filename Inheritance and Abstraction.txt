Inheritance allows child class to access non-private members of parent class thus achieving reusability but parent class cannot access members of child
Code derived from parant class can be given new functionality in child class
Types
	Single Inheritance
		Single parent class and single child class
	
	Multiple Inheritance
		More than one parent class

	Multi-level
		Inheritance from grandparent class to parent class
		and from parent class to child class

java supports single inheritance in case of classes

if we create main in child it will be able to access members of parent hence main class will be child class


Abstraction
abstraction will allow us to show what is going to happen but not how it will happen
In order to achieve abstraction,we can create abstract classes
abstract classes are the one in which there are methods without body,only method declaration and not the definition
we can say that abstract classes are incomplete classes and hence they need to be inherited and given body to methods from abstract class
As these classes are incomplete we cannot create objects of abstract classes

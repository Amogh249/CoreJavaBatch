Constructors
	Constructors are special methods which are used to initialize 	member variables at run time/dynamically
	Constructors have same name as that of class name
	Constructors need not to be invoked separately using objects,
	they are invoked automatically as soon as object of the class 	is created so we can say that as many times you create the 	object,those many times constructor will be invoked
	Constructors cannot have any logic within its body,we can 	initialize member variables only and hence constructors do not 	have return type
	Constructors can have access specifier
	Constructors cannot be inherited
	Constructors can receive parameters as same as other methods

Enumerations
	Enumerations allow developers to provide range of values to 		user to choose from
	Enumerations are treated as level that of class 
	hence it can be declared outside the class as well

Professionally followed conventions
ClassName		=>UpperCamelCase
methods,variables	=>lowerCamelCase
objects 		=>same as class name in lowerCamelCase
Constants		=>UPPERCASE
